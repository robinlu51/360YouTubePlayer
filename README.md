# 360YouTubePlayer
 This is the repository for my 360-degree video player, implemented with the YouTube iframe API. 
 Developed in JavaScript and HTML.
 This project is part of my graduate thesis at Virginia Tech, you can access the full thesis document here: https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/items/546ac03c-bdcb-4b2e-b67a-249021bfe21a

 The main goal of this project is to investigate and develop alternative control methods for 360-degree videos on 2D screens, without requiring additional hardware that could be inaccessible for many like VR headsets.
 And through the quantitative and qualitative analysis, understand what design elements can improve both usability and user experience.
