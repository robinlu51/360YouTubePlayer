# 360YouTubePlayer
 My 360 video player with YouTube iframe API. 
 Developed in JavaScript and HTML.
 The main goal of this project is to develop alternative control methods for 360-degree videos on a 2D screen, without requiring additional hardware that could be inaccessible for many like VR headsets.
