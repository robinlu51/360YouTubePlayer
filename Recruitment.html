<h1>Recruiting participants for a research study on 360-degree videos on 2D screen</h1>

<p>The EchoLab at Virginia Tech is inviting you to participate in a research study on immersive 360-degree videos on 2D screens, IRB# 20-587. Our team is studying alternative methods of control when navigating a 360-degree video, using no more than a mouse and a keyboard. The goal of the study is to investigate different ways users interact with the 360 video player and evaluate the effectiveness of each control method.</p>

<p>This study will take place remotely, in the comfort of your own home, or any environment of your choosing. The participants will be asked to complete several tasks in a 360 video player, such as locating and tracing objects in the video, using several different control methods we will provide. Participants will also be asked for comments on these different control methods.</p>

<p>The experiment session will take approximately 60 minutes to complete and will happen completely virtually. We&rsquo;re looking for participants who:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Are 18 years or older </li>
    <li>Are able to understand basic instructions in English and fill out a brief survey in English</li>
    <li>Have access to a computer and a stable internet connection</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that it is recommended, especially if you&rsquo;re using Virginia Tech&rsquo;s campus wifi, to use a browser you&rsquo;ve previously logged into YouTube with. If YouTube recognizes you as a bot, you will unfortunately not be eligible to participate in this study.</p>

<p>If you agree to take part in this research study, the research team will enter the email addresses into a random drawing and compensation will be given to approximately ten percent of participants as a $10 gift card. The odds of being selected will be maintained as 1 in 10. The participants will be contacted separately.</p>

<p>For participation in the study, please follow the following QuestionPro survey link, you may take this survey remotely at any location of your choosing. </p>
